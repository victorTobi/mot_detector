# mot_detector
works with the camera and is able to recognize changes in frame to identify movements. whenever an object enters the frame the time in which the object entered and exited is registered in a csv file . 
The time log for the program overwrites when another session is started so you should extract the data first if its important before you start another session.
if you are uncomfortable with the overwriting you are free to modify the code.
The file where the object times will be saved wil be automatically named "Times"

THIS CODE SHOULD RUN PERFECTLY AS FAR AS YOU HAVE PYTHON INSTALLED!!
